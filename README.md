# ASM_IDE

Making assembly language programming easier with an all-in-one IDE

## Getting Started

The application, if run via the python interpreter, must be run using "asm_ide.py"
The following files exist in the repository that comprises of the source code:
1) asm_ide.py -- The main GUI application
2) classify.py -- houses the Machine Learning backend of the application
3) CompilerForMachineCode.py -- Converts given assembly instruction into machine code
4) interpreter1.py -- responsible for converting user input in english to assemby code
5) simulator.py -- simulator that executes the instructions, assuming the role of a virtual RISC processor
6) Speech_recog.py -- convert speech to text via Google's Speech Recognition API
7) styles.py -- theme settings for the GUI
8) trainlabel.py -- houses the training labels for the Machine Learning model

### Prerequisites

1) python >= 3.6.9 <br />
2) yaml >= 3.12 <br />
3) json >= 2.0.9 <br />
4) numpy >= 1.18.0 <br />
5) sklearn >= 0.22.2.post1 <br />
